# Weather-App

This project retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the information in a pleasing way.

## Motivation

I was motivated to create this App because of the design of The [Weather Networks 7 Days column](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/alberta/calgary).
I decided I wanted to try to make a similar looking design with whatever data the OpenWeatherMap APi provided.
